Need to tell R to send stuff back to github
Doesn't automatically perform version control pushing stuff back to github

###Load the packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(leaflet)
library(spatstat)
library(maptools)

###Column graph of Texas oil spills (look at oils spills csv data)

```{r}
oil_spills <- read_csv("oil_spills.csv")

#create a new data frame and filter oil_spills
df <- oil_spills %>% 
  filter(`Accident State` == "TX" & `Accident Year` < 2017) %>% 
  group_by(`Accident Year`) %>% 
  summarise(Loss = sum(`Net Loss (Barrels)`) ) #create new variable called Loss

#change column names
colnames(df) <- c("Year", "Loss")

ggplot(df, aes(x = Year, y = Loss)) +
  geom_col()
```



Half as much oil spilled in TX land over these 7 years than was spilled in th Exxon-Valdez oil spill
